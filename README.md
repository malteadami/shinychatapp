# ShinyChatApp

This Shiny app is built around the capabilities of the shinychat package, leveraging its features to create an interactive experience.

The front-end allows users to switch system prompts and models, as well as open multiple chats to interact with the OpenAI API.

To run this shiny app, you must first generate an OpenAI API key and configure it in your environment as OPENAI_API_KEY
